## üîç Security Features

- Implements NIST [SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) guidelines for password security
- Uses cryptographically secure random number generation (CSPRNG)
- Calculates and displays password entropy for objective strength measurement
- Enforces minimum security requirements with real-time validation
- Provides educational information about password best practices

## üìä Password Strength Analysis

The application uses multiple factors to determine password strength:

1. **Entropy Calculation**: Mathematical measurement of randomness
2. **Character Diversity**: Analysis of character type distribution
3. **Pattern Detection**: Identification of common sequences or repetitions
4. **Length Assessment**: Evaluation based on password length
